The sprite animation of a Pokémon being caught in a Poké Ball typically involves the ball being thrown, hitting the Pokémon, and then the Pokémon shrinking and disappearing into the ball, with the ball shaking and flashing before closing. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown of the animation:
The Throw:
The Poké Ball is thrown towards the Pokémon, often with a slight arc or curve to its trajectory. 
The Impact:
The Poké Ball makes contact with the Pokémon, and the Pokémon may briefly recoil or struggle. 
The Capture:
The Pokémon shrinks and disappears into the Poké Ball, sometimes with a brief flash of light or energy. 
The Shaking and Flashing:
The Poké Ball shakes and flashes, indicating that the Pokémon is being captured. 
The Closing:
The Poké Ball closes and the animation ends.
